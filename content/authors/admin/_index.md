I'm Tomoki Okuno. I am a MS Biostatistics student at UCLA and a graduate student researcher at David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA working with Dr.Jin Zhou and Dr.Hua Zhou. My main interest is Longevity: how do we age, and can we slow, stop, or even reverse the aging process? My short-term goal is to transfer into a PhD program next year and conduct research related to aging. My long-term goal is to contribute to realizing an extended healthy lifespan in Japan, both as a biostatistician and a business developer.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am into keeping fit in order to live up to 150 years old.
