abstract:
Objective. To integrate long-term daily continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device data with electronic health records (EHR) for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D) in the national Veterans Affairs Healthcare System to assess real-world patterns of CGM use and the reliability of EHR-based CGM information. Research Design and Methods. This observational study used Dexcom CGM device data linked with EHR (from 2015 to 2020) for a large national cohort of patients with diabetes. We tracked the initiation and consistency of CGM use, assessed concordance of CGM use and measures of glucose control between CGM device data and EHR records, and examined results by age, ethnicity, and diabetes type. Results. The time from pharmacy release of CGM to patients to initiation of uploading CGM data to Dexcom servers averaged 3 weeks but demonstrated wide variation among individuals; importantly, this delay decreased markedly over the later years. The average daily wear time of CGM exceeded 22 h over nearly 3 years of follow-up. Patterns of CGM use were generally consistent across age, race/ethnicity groups, and diabetes type. There was strong concordance between EHR-based estimates of CGM use and Dexcom CGM wear time and between estimates of glucose control from both sources. Conclusions. The study demonstrates our ability to reliably integrate CGM devices and EHR data to provide valuable insights into CGM use patterns. The results indicate in the real-world environment that CGM is worn consistently over many years for both patients with T1D and T2D within the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System and is similar across major race/ethnic groups and age-groups.
