abstract: Both long- and short-term glycemic variability have been associated with incident diabetes complications. We evaluated their relative and potential additive effects on incident renal complications in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes trial. A marker of short-term glycemic variability, 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), was measured in 4,000 random 12-month postrandomization plasma samples (when hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] was stable). Visit-to-visit fasting plasma glucose coefficient of variation (CV-FPG) was determined from 4 months postrandomization until the end point of microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria. Using Cox proportional hazards models, high CV-FPG and low 1,5-AG were independently associated with microalbuminuria after adjusting for clinical risk factors. However, only the CV-FPG association remained after additional adjustment for average HbA1c. Only CV-FPG was a significant risk factor for macroalbuminuria. This post hoc analysis indicates that long-term rather than short-term glycemic variability better predicts the risk of renal disease in type 2 diabetes.
