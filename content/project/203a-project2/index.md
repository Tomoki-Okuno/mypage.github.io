This project is the final assignment for Biostatistics 203A: Introduction to Data Management and Statistical Computing in Fall Quarter 2021.

No specific topic was assigned and students were expected to employ computational methods in R they learned in class, such as, statistical testing, modeling, or clustering, to health-related data sets of our own interest to reach some conclusion. Students were also responsible for preparing and organizing a written report containing tables, figures, and a text summary of methods and results.

My topic focused on the disparity in life expectancy among states in the U.S. Principal component analysis and a clustering algorithm were used to examine what factors might affect this difference.
