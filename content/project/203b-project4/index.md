This project was the final assignment for Biostatistics 203B: Introduction to Data Science in Winter Quarter 2022.

The topics were related to imputation methods and prediction approaches, such as the logistic regression (`glm()`), logistic regression with lasso penalty (glmnet), random forest, and neural network using keras.
